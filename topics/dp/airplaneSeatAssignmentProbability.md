### [1227\. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/airplane-seat-assignment-probability/)

Difficulty: **Medium**


`n` passengers board an airplane with exactly `n` seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of passengers will:

*   Take their own seat if it is still available, 
*   Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied 

What is the probability that the n-th person can get his own seat?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: The first person can only get the first seat.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 0.50000
Explanation: The second person has a probability of 0.5 to get the second seat (when first person gets the first seat).
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10^5`


#### Solution

Language: **JavaScript**

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var nthPersonGetsNthSeat = function(n) {
    return n === 1 ? 1 : 0.5
};
```
