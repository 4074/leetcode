### [263\. Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/)

Difficulty: **Easy**

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. For example, `6, 8` are ugly while `14` is not ugly since it includes another prime factor `7`.

Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
