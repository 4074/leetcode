### 242\. Valid Anagram

Difficulty: **Easy**

Given two strings _s_ and _t_, write a function to determine if _t_ is an anagram of _s_.

For example,  
_s_ = "anagram", _t_ = "nagaram", return true.  
_s_ = "rat", _t_ = "car", return false.

**Note:**  
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

**Follow up:**  
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
