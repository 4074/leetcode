### [2185\. Counting Words With a Given Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-words-with-a-given-prefix/)

Difficulty: **Easy**


You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return _the number of strings in_ `words` _that contain_ `pref` _as a **prefix**_.

A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= words.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100`
*   `words[i]` and `pref` consist of lowercase English letters.


#### Solution

Language: **JavaScript**

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {string} pref
 * @return {number}
 */
var prefixCount = function(words, pref) {
  return words.filter(w => w.startsWith(pref)).length
};
```
